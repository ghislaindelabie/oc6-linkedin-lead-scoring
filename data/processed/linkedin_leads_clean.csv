I have 12+ years of experience in product management, gained through working with North American high-tech software companies in France and as an expatriate in the United States and Germany. Over the years, I progressed from Product Manager to Head of Product.

My experience spans:
● Company types: Large corporations (AT&T, Lucent Technologies, Nortel, Alcatel, Orange) as well as startups (Cloudwatt, Wallix) and even a unicorn (Shift).
● Industries: Cloud computing, SaaS, open-source applications, mobile telecom, telecom network APIs, cybersecurity, and AI/ML.
● Development methodologies: Both waterfall models with long release cycles and agile frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.

I have expertise in all three pillars of product management:
● Strategy: Defining strategic vision, analyzing addressable markets and competition, drafting Strategic Requirement Documents, managing budget and costs, applying Blue Ocean strategy, building business cases, structuring governance, and designing strategic roadmaps.
● Execution: Prioritizing backlogs, defining product roadmaps, writing specifications (epics, stories), designing interfaces, and delivering demos.
● Go-to-Market & Growth: Defining sales and channel strategies, crafting product positioning and messaging, creating marketing assets (brochures, product descriptions), drafting contracts (online, OEM, business contribution), setting pricing strategies, evangelizing products, and training sales teams.

In 2020, I founded my own consulting firm, providing product management services, delivering conferences—including one with an audience of 388 people online—and offering training and coaching for startup founders, executives, and product managers seeking an external perspective.

I've been in your shoes: 

Sitting on valuable data but struggling to turn it into defensible products. 
Watching competitors ship AI features while your team debates strategy decks. 
Managing engineering teams excited about the latest models but unclear on business impact.


At Clustree and Cornerstone, I drove $30M+ ARR in new AI product initiatives while managing cross-functional teams of AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and product managers, serving millions of active users daily.

Across 13+ years in tech, I shipped products as both software engineer and product manager across nearly every type of B2B company:

Pre-market-fit startup? ✅
Fast-scaling SaaS scaleup? ✅
AI startup acquihired? ✅
NASDAQ-traded Silicon Valley company? ✅

Along the way, I launched my own company, mentored dozens of engineers and PMs, and advised several founders navigating growth and transformation.

Now, in 2025, I help scaling tech companies turn their AI confusion into shipped products that actually move the business.

My clients don't want another ""AI initiative."" They want someone who's navigated the gap between AI potential and product reality, someone who can turn their company's unique advantages into something shippable, defensible, and useful.

Here's what I bring:
* Strategic clarity on what to build (and what to skip)
* Org enablement to align product, data, and AI teams
* Hands-on product leadership from someone who's actually shipped

If you're leading a sharp team but still:
* Feel like your AI roadmap is a deck, not a plan
* Sit on valuable data but don't know how to unlock it
* Watch competitors ship while you're stuck in thinking mode

You're not behind. You're just missing the link between tech potential and product reality.

Dynamique et engagé, je cultive l’empathie et j’apprécie volontiers le dépassement de soi, du moins celui qui participe de l’écoute de soi et se forme au sens de l’autre. 

Depuis 1999, je pratique les évolutions du monde du travail et ses parties prenantes, à travers divers modèles économiques : sociétés commerciales, sociétés d’économie mixte, banque mutualiste, établissement public de santé, chambre consulaire, ONG, associations.

De 2006 à 2019, j’ai assumé les fonctions de DGA et de DRH d’organisations complexes de l’ESS de 500 à 1200 salariés, en Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (ADSEAN), puis en Normandie (ACSEA).
Alors membre de la commission RH et du groupe emploi formation de la commission sociale de l’OPE Nexem, j’ai animé régulièrement un groupe sur la thématique du dialogue social, tout en participant aux travaux sur le projet conventionnel. 
Dans le cadre de mes dernières activités, j’ai également siégé au collège des personnalités qualifiées du CROCT de Normandie, et en tant que membre de commission au CREFOP de cette même région, via Nexem et l’Udes. Référent de l’espace régional de dialogue social initié par l’Udes, j’ai coopéré à la création et au co-développement de cette innovation territoriale.

Thanks to an explosion of data and ever-improving computing power, neural networks now infer solutions with astonishing speed and accuracy. 
Integrated with microservices, expert systems, and other specialized technologies, these “agents” can take on an expanding range of tasks once handled by people or clunky legacy tools, radically transforming workflows.

My prediction? 
- By 2040, 95% of jobs that rely mostly on a computer will vanish. 
- And by the same year, half of the services offered by today’s S&P 500 companies don’t even exist yet. 
The AI revolution is already here—its impact will be bigger and faster than most can imagine.

The first 10 years of my career, I grew into Talent acquisition from sourcing niche roles all over EMEA to building Talent Acquisition operations from scratch, taking them to an international unicorn level.

I didn’t grow up dreaming of becoming a Talent search expert, but found my passion by traveling and speaking with top tier Talent acquisition and Tech leaders.

While building scalable solutions, I have learned a lot from my successes and a lot more from my mistakes. That’s how Fledge was born.

L’open source a profondément influencé ma manière d’apprendre et de travailler, en me révélant la puissance du partage et de la collaboration. Cette approche m’a persuadée qu’il est indispensable d’agir collectivement pour repenser nos manières de vivre, de travailler et de gouverner.
