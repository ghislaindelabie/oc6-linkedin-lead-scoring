In the last 10 years have been an ecosystem and platform strategy advisor to Fortune 500s, SMBs, startups, networks, think-tanks, cultural NGOs, and to developmental organizations like the UNDP, both in the public and private sector, regarding matters of portfolio management or organizational change. I'm currently helping a few selected, successful and passionate brick and mortar businesses scaling across from being family-owned small scale to franchise with a global reach. I'm open to collaborations as a product and operations lead or strategist in exciting product or HR positions, with a strong bias for contexts that leverage exponential technologies, human potential, work with regenerative practices and/or address human existential threats. I'm strongly interested in projects and organizations trying to bridge real-world assets on-chain and enabling the agency of IRL communities. I'm used to work closely with cross-functional teams of top-tier software developers, designers, and domain experts to break silos across the organizations I work with. With powerful methodologies and scalable approaches to collaborative strategy making, I deliver value at the intersection of tech and business domains. I co-founded boundaryless.io and significantly contributed to creating, developing and disseminating the Platform Design Toolkit (PDT), the EEEO Toolkit (based on Haier’s Rendanheyi), and the set of training and consulting products around them. PDT is today one of the most comprehensive and widely adopted methodologies for the design, prototyping, launch, and scale of ecosystem strategies. Fully released in Creative Commons.

One day, it may be possible to cure degenerative diseases that consist of the loss of one or several specialized cell functions, as well as to decelerate the deterioration our bodies experience during aging. However, several hurdles must be surpassed to establish cell transplantation therapies, a major one being rejection by the recipient's immune system. This challenge is particularly prominent for autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, where the immune system mediates the destruction of self-tissues. During my PhD, in the laboratories of Jack Strominger and Chad Cowan at Harvard University, I worked on transcriptional regulation in human pregnancy, a long-standing enigma in immunology and a seldom studied model of immune tolerance. In addition, I was the first to show successful genome editing in primary human T cells and hematopoietic stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and was part of a team creating universally compatible human pluripotent stem cells. As a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratories of Qizhi Tang and Jeff Bluestone at the University of California San Francisco, I used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in to replace the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) gene with an anti-HLA-A2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene in primary human regulatory T cells (Tregs), creating CAR Tregs with suppressive function specifically upon recognizing HLA-A2 that traffic to transplanted HLA-A2+ human islets. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina and the Hollings Cancer Center. My goal is to design and develop engineered immune cell therapies for autoimmune disease, cancer, and aging.

Since I was a child, I dreamed of becoming an engineer and working in the field of cultural heritage. However, reality proved different, as I encountered significant challenges in securing job opportunities, despite my academic excellence. In 2022, I completed my master's degree with honors. That was a tremendous achievement, but I soon discovered that the path to success was not quickly paved. I applied for numerous university positions, only to be rejected because I did not belong to certain groups. I felt despair and frustration, wishing I had a voice that could be heard. Despite all this, I did not give up. I decided to pursue my studies and complete the requirements for my Ph.D. There were moments when I felt I should stop, but I firmly believed that I could be a role model for women in my country. I want to show that a female engineer can work in archaeological excavation sites and that she can achieve her dreams regardless of the challenges. Today, I share this story to inspire every woman facing similar difficulties and scientific writing. I want to tell all: do not let society dictate your destiny. Keep striving for your dreams and be an example for the next generation. We can change stereotypes; let us continue to work hard and achieve success. My approach integrates innovative technology, such as laser scanning, AI, and digital heritage modeling, to protect and preserve the intricate fabric of our past. This dedication to integrating advanced methodologies into archaeology positions women at the forefront of cultural heritage preservation. تدور قصتي من قلب الأردن، حيث تواجه الشابات التهميش بسبب الأعراف الاجتماعية. واجهت صعوبات في الحصول على فرص عمل رغم تفوقي الأكاديمي. بعد حصولي على الماجستير بتفوق في 2022، تقدمت للعديد من الوظائف الجامعية لكنني رُفضت لعدم انتمائي لمجموعات معينة، مما سبب لي الإحباط. لكنني لم أستسلم، وقررت استكمال دراستي للدكتوراه، مؤمنة بأنني يمكن أن أكون نموذجًا يحتذي به النساء في بلدي. هذا الالتزام يضع النساء في مقدمة جهود الحفاظ على التراث، وهو يتعارض مع أهداف اتفاقية القضاء على جميع أشكال التمييز ضد المرأة (سيداو). اليوم، أشارك قصتي لإلهام كل امرأة تواجه صعوبات. كباحثة ومتخصصة في التراث الثقافي والتقنيات الرقمية، أعمل عند تقاطع التاريخ والتكنولوجيا. أُسهم في تطوير حلول ذكية للتوثيق الأثري، وأقود مشاريع دولية ترتكز على الابتكار والهوية. شغوفة ببناء جسور معرفية بين الماضي والمستقبل من خلال الذكاء الاصطناعي، الواقع الافتراضي، وسرد القصص التراثية.",,Consultant,1

His practice explores the inaudible, intangible, and invisible in digital and physical spaces, critically engaging with the societal and environmental shifts driven by technology. De Wilde’s work navigates speculative futures and complex systems, offering innovative perspectives on contemporary challenges.

He is best known for his Blackest-Black nano-engineered artworks (2010), developed with Rice University and NASA. This groundbreaking project, which examines the concept of nothingness, earned the 2010 Ars Electronica Next Idea Award and the Best European Creative Cities Award. Featured in Huffington Post, Dazed, and TED Ideas Worth Spreading, the work inspired artists worldwide, including Sir Anish Kapoor with Vantablack.

De Wilde’s practice has been marked by continuous innovation. In 2006, he explored interspecies communication with weakly electric fish. In 2010, his NRS series introduced generative data-driven works he described as “painting with data to create landscape paintings of the information age.” His collaboration with the Australian National University’s Department of Quantum Science in 2013 resulted in quantum sculptures, driven by true random numbers generated from a physical quantum source.

In 2016, De Wilde developed the world’s first AI and evolutionary algorithm-generated 3D-printed art, exhibited at Ars Electronica, and an interactive neural network artwork (2015), now part of the Frost Museum’s permanent collection. His research includes the creation of an AI-encoded Dazzle camouflage technique, subverting metadata labeling systems using evolutionary computing. 

He published several papers e.g.  ""Artistic Approaches to Design and Manufacturing Techniques Dedicated to Space Applications"" (Leonardo, MIT Press, 2019).

His achievements include recognition as a finalist for the Giant Steps X-Prize Lab (MIT), ZKM App Art Award, TED World Wide Talent Search (2013), and the Arab Bank NFT Prize, as well as winning the Herbert W. Franke Contact Attempt (2024)  and Serpentine Future Art Ecosystems (2025).
