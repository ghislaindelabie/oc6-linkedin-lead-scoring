That’s why I craft Natural Search User Experiences (""SEO"") for 20 years by:
- Understanding users’ needs, intents, and behaviors
- Creating meaningful, emotional content and useful services that help them achieve their goals
- Prioritizing strategies that truly benefit users and brands over short-term tactics like artificial link building or guest blogging, which often deliver limited long-term value — though I contribute to media campaigns, social networks, and organically earned backlinks for SEO.

I also enjoy developing SEO tools and steering SEO like a product, using agile methods to continuously test, learn, and optimize — aligning efforts with both user expectations and business objectives.

My 1st book  on ""How the philosophy of AI can help us transform"" is OUT !","I am a tech entrepreneur, lecturer, author, columnist, and TED speaker, passionate about shaping a human-centered future with Artificial Intelligence. 

After four years working in London’s financial markets, I chose to build something more ethical and meaningful. That’s how I founded Bionoor, a pioneering social enterprise rooted in sustainability and fair trade, operating between France, Algeria, and across Europe, Africa, and Asia. 

A decade later, I returned to my technological roots and created BIGmama Technology. With BIGmama and our flagship product Hyko.ai, I design AI platforms and intelligent agents that amplify human expertise and creativity — never to replace them. 

As a writer and public speaker — contributing to Les Échos, appearing on BFM Business, teaching at Sciences Po Paris, and sharing my vision on the TED stage — I explore a constant red thread: how AI can transform our lives, our work, and our societies for the better. My latest book, Super-Papillon (Rio Bravo, 2025), prefaced by Alexandre Jardin, develops this vision, presenting AI as a kind of “Super-Socrates” that can help us question, grow, and reinvent ourselves in an age of hybrid intelligence. 

What drives me is disruption with purpose. At the crossroads of innovation, philosophy, and social impact, I work to inspire individuals and organizations to embrace technology not as a replacement, but as a force for autonomy, creativity, and human growth.","Entrepreneurship, Sustainability, Organic Farming",,,,No,,,,,,,,,"Name: Hadj Khelil

With over 20 years of experience starting and running companies in three continents, Thomas’ expertise involves all aspects of assessing disruptive technologies, creating new businesses, fundraising, growth, and developing new markets or partnerships. With Baracoda Group, Thomas has focused on cutting-edge tech products ever since his first venture in connected objects: a Bluetooth barcode scanner released in 2001. 

After successfully exiting Baracoda in 2008, Thomas had the chance to work as an executive manager for both Microsoft and Google. At both companies he ran projects related to strategic deal negotiations and business development, managing business with European media and  telecommunication groups. Under his leadership, Google’s revenue was multiplied 3x on his product lines.

Later, Thomas came home to Baracoda, rejoining as CEO to develop the brand and further its global reach. Applying what he learned working for industry giants, he’s managed to launch such game-changers as his line of connected toothbrushes with Colgate and a series of smart-mirror connected products in 2019. With his input and visionary leadership, Baracoda has built a strong relationship with the world’s biggest leaders in their respective industries. A shortlist of his major collaborators includes Colgate, Pierre Fabre and Wella. 

As a graduate of the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l’Administration Economique (ENSAE), Thomas is heavily involved with schools, startups and incubators — a major part of the French innovation community. He currently sits as  a State Representative at the board  of ARTE France (a European Public Television Service that produces cultural programs). During the academic year, he’s a regular lecturer at top French institutions such as ESCP, ESSEC, HEC, Telecom Paris and Corps des Mines. In 2017, he was invited at Stanford University to speak about how he created the connected oral care consumer product category.

Counting 77  patents and ten CES Innovation Awards under his belt, Thomas was sworn into the Legion of Honor by the French President in 2018. Today, he’s focused on partnerships and product launches aiming to create a daily healthtech ecosystem. He’s working to turn all the key tenets of his smart bathroom vision into a reality.","Internet of Things (IoT), Entrepreneurship, Mobile Applications",Sent to another campaign,AI in media French,AI in media French,Yes,2026-02-24T11:46:44.859Z,2026-02-24T11:46:44.859Z,2026-02-25T07:00:17.014Z,2026-02-25T07:00:17.014Z,,,2026-02-24T11:47:08.346Z,,"Name: Thomas Serval

• Gestion de production & intégration technique
• Très bonne connaissance des DCC (Maya, Blender, Unreal, Arnold, Guérilla, Substance, Mari et j’en passe…), de leur fonctionnement et intégration en prod.
• Pratique avancée de Python dans un contexte de prod

The digital transformation of business models is one of my priorities. It enables:

- To keep the consumer at the heart of each strategy
- To implement omnichannel strategies 

For me, results are achieved by:
- Identifying the true key performance levers,
- Defining & executing strategic plans with quality and speed,
- Constantly challenging & adapting such plans to address market & societal changes, 
- Fostering an open, and at the same time demanding, culture.

I am currently a technology reporter for Euronews, where I cover the artificial intelligence boom, mis/disinformation and fintech. Within these high level stories, I try to find a human angle wherever possible so we have a better idea of how these technological changes are impacting all of us. 

Before moving to Europe, I was an award-winning correspondent for CBC News in Canada's Arctic. I focused on telling stories about underrepresented groups and on some of the biggest issues facing our time, including deep dives into climate change and the housing crisis. I won an RTDNA, one of Canada's most prestigious awards, for that work and received seven other nominations for my documentary work.

I also have a keen interest in international relations. My career so far has given me many occasions to see how it works up close: from my view in scrums as a national reporter on Ottawa's Parliament Hill or with my seat at the table as a young Canadian diplomat in Geneva and Brussels.

Now, I'm looking to gain more international experience to prepare for my ultimate career goal of being a full-time foreign correspondent. I've already reported from several countries, including: France, Saudi Arabia, Nepal, Rwanda, Switzerland, Mexico and the United States. 

When I'm not reporting, you can find me hiking through France's beautiful country-side, learning a new language (I'm perfecting my Spanish) or volunteering.

I’m passionate about helping Public Service Media thrive in the platform age...and beyond...by combining sharp strategic thinking, inclusive leadership, and a strong belief in the power of collective innovation.

📍 Since starting at the BBC in 2007, I've worked across public and private sectors—from consulting and mobile tech to media partnerships—building bridges between audiences, technology, and public value.
📍 At RTBF, I currently shape the strategy and partnerships behind Auvio, our on‑demand platform, helping it grow into a cornerstone of our digital offering.
📍 As Chair of the EBU Digital Committee, I lead a pan-European effort to tackle digital challenges—from AI and platform dominance to audience reconnection—with shared, actionable solutions.

With a diverse academic background (including an MBA from London Business School and UCLA Anderson in Los Angeles specialising in technology, media & entertainment), I bring both analytical and creative thinking to complex strategic issues.

What I care most about:
- Making digital public media accessible and distinctive
- Structuring deals and products that serve users and mission alike
- Creating spaces for peers to share, learn, and act
- Keeping the big picture in focus—while delivering practical results
